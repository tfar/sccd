	Simple Cryptography for Constrained Devices
==

This is a C cryptography library targeting constrained applications. It does NOT implement cryptographic primitives but instead provides an abstract interface for secure elliptic curve cryptography implementations and secure hash functions.

Furthermore it provides benchmarks for performance and stability across its backends for comparison.
